# PSFvisual
Educational point spread function tool

PSFvisual is an educational tool aimed at underclassmen undergraduate astronomy students who are learning about the point spread function. 
It is an interactive, streamlit based web-app where students can test which parameters impact the shape of a point spread function in real time using sliders.
There are modules for both diffraction limited and seeing limited cases, and how they compare.

GETTING STARTED 
To use the tool, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. 
PSFvisual requires the following libraries: numpy, PIL, astropy, matplotlib, and streamlit. 

After installing the required libraries, you can launch the tool locally by running the following command while you are in the folder containing the PSF_Visual.py file:
streamlit run PSF_Visual.py

Or you can use the link found [here](https://psfvisual.streamlit.app/)

This will launch the tool in your web browser.
